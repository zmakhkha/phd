 	abstractNote={The subjectivity/objectivity dichotomy subdivides the field of educational evaluation. These two controversial concepts are very discussed because of their impact on the evaluation process and its results. While the objectivity of the teacher-evaluator constitutes the ultimate goal in any educational evaluation, the subjectivity of this last appears as a reality which relates to his status as a thinking subject. Making part of this general question and based on a survey of 40 secondary school teachers, this paper aims to analyze the influence of five factors external to the evaluation on the correction of written tests during formative evaluation, which are the teachers representations, the pygmalion effect, the behavior of the learners-evaluated in class, and the states of nervousness and tiredness of the teacherevaluator. The factors analyzed are related to the subjectivity of this last. Finally, it is a question of comparing the attitudes of the teachers surveyed during the process of evaluation with what they have as representations, ideas, and opinions about the influence of the aforementioned factors on their evaluative practice.},
