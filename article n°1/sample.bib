 	abstractNote={The subjectivity/objectivity dichotomy subdivides the field of educational evaluation. These two controversial concepts are very discussed because of their impact on the evaluation process and its results. While the objectivity of the teacher-evaluator constitutes the ultimate goal in any educational evaluation, the subjectivity of this last appears as a reality which relates to his status as a thinking subject. Making part of this general question and based on a survey of 40 secondary school teachers, this paper aims to analyze the influence of five factors external to the evaluation on the correction of written tests during formative evaluation, which are the teachers representations, the pygmalion effect, the behavior of the learners-evaluated in class, and the states of nervousness and tiredness of the teacherevaluator. The factors analyzed are related to the subjectivity of this last. Finally, it is a question of comparing the attitudes of the teachers surveyed during the process of evaluation with what they have as representations, ideas, and opinions about the influence of the aforementioned factors on their evaluative practice.},

To evaluate this claim, we reviewed several types of studies including studies of student note taking, observations of students during lectures, and self-reports of student attention, as well as studies using physiological measures of attention. We found that the research on which this estimate is based provides little support for the belief that students’ attention declines after 10 to 15 min. Most studies failed to account for individual differences in attention. Our findings indicate that instructors should take into account individual differences in student attention when lecturing and determine whether students are recording the relevant content of the lecture in their notes.}, number={2}, journal={Teaching of Psychology}, author={Wilson, Karen and Korn, James H.}, year={2007}, month=apr, pages={85–89}, language={en} }

Data were collected by means of a questionnaire with thirteen English teachers from extracurricular courses offered at the Federal University of Santa Catarina. The results showed that 8 teachers reported using videos about 20% of their classes; 1, 40%; 1, 60%; and 3, 80%. Most teachers use videos from YouTube, TED talk videos, DVDs in general, and videos accompanying the textbooks. For the selection criteria, teachers use: video length, authenticity, difficulty level, topic adequacy in relation to the topic in class, grammar and vocabulary presentation in context; and for the instructional use, videos are used mostly to teach vocabulary and grammar, introduce and explain the topics related to the unit, contextualize the language and foster topic discussions, show diversity of language with abstract/poetic language, promote skills development, and prepare for activities. The perceived benefits include contextualization and authentic use of the language, language use in its natural pace, topic introduction and explanation assistance, attractiveness and engagement, delivery of visual input, and use of subtitles. The possible conclusions are that digital videos are present and can contribute for L2 development, and that teachers are capitalizing on their best use in their L2 classrooms.}, journal={Domínios de Lingu@gem}, author={Tumolo, Celso Henrique Soufen and Bender, Marinho Cristiel}, year={2023}, month=nov, pages={e1758} }

This article presents a potentially useful theoretical model, the Teaching Through Interactions framework, which posits teacher-student interactions as a central driver for student learning and that teacherstudent interactions can be organized into three major domains. Results from 1,482 classrooms provide evidence for distinct emotional, organizational, and instructional domains of teacherstudent interaction. It also appears that a three-factor structure is a better fit to observational data than alternative one- and two-domain models of teacher-student classroom interactions, and that the three-domain structure is generalizable from 6th through 12th grade. Implications for practitioners, stakeholders, and researchers are discussed.}, number={5–6}, journal={The Journal of Early Adolescence}, author={Hafen, Christopher A. and Hamre, Bridget K. and Allen, Joseph P. and Bell, Courtney A. and Gitomer, Drew H. and Pianta, Robert C.}, year={2015}, month=jun, pages={651–680}, language={en} }

Unfortunately, the study of engagement has been stymied by a lack of valid and efficient measures. We introduce the advanced, analytic, and automated (AAA) approach to measure engagement at fine-grained temporal resolutions. The AAA measurement approach is grounded in embodied theories of cognition and affect, which advocate a close coupling between thought and action. It uses machine-learned computational models to automatically infer mental states associated with engagement (e.g., interest, flow) from machine-readable behavioral and physiological signals (e.g., facial expressions, eye tracking, click-stream data) and from aspects of the environmental context. We present15 case studies that illustrate the potential of the AAA approach for measuring engagement in digital learning environments. We discuss strengths and weaknesses of the AAA approach, concluding that it has significant promise to catalyze engagement research.}, number={2}, journal={Educational Psychologist}, author={D’Mello, Sidney and Dieterle, Ed and Duckworth, Angela}, year={2017}, month=apr, pages={104–123}, language={en} }
